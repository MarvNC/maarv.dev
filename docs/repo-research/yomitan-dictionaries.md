## One-liner
A large, actively maintained dictionary hub for Yomitan that publishes ready-to-import Japanese and Chinese dictionaries while also housing the scripts and workflows used to build and update them.

## What It Does
- Curates and distributes a broad collection of dictionaries for Yomitan across Japanese, Mandarin Chinese, and Cantonese.
- Covers multiple dictionary types, including term definitions, kanji and hanzi reference data, frequency lists, grammar resources, and name dictionaries.
- Provides practical installation guidance, recommended dictionary sets, and ordering advice for learners at different stages.
- Aggregates both project-owned dictionaries and community-contributed dictionaries, making the repo a central discovery point.
- Maintains changelog-driven updates so dictionary packages and links stay current over time.

## Stack And Delivery
- JavaScript-based tooling is used to scrape, convert, normalize, and package dictionary sources into Yomitan-compatible outputs.
- Distribution is delivery-first: users can download prepared dictionary bundles directly, then import into Yomitan.
- Repository content combines dataset artifacts with build scripts and documentation, enabling repeatable updates instead of one-off drops.
- README documentation acts as the operational front door with setup paths, category navigation, and maintenance notes.

## Portfolio Notes
- Strong example of a high-value language-learning data product with sustained maintenance and measurable community adoption.
- Demonstrates end-to-end ownership: data sourcing, transformation, packaging, publishing, and user-facing documentation.
- Good portfolio anchor for data engineering plus developer-experience work in niche but highly engaged communities.
