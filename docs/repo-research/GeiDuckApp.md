## One-liner
GeiDuckApp is a private TypeScript learning app project focused on Cantonese spaced-repetition study workflows, built as a full-stack Next.js application.

## What It Does
- Provides a browser-based study flow for repeated review, consistent with SRS-style language learning usage.
- Targets Cantonese learning use cases and appears positioned as a personal product rather than a generic starter app.
- Combines app-level UX with backend-backed data flows so users can manage and run review sessions in one place.
- Includes dashboard-style learning progress surfaces (for example streak/review tracking) based on current project structure notes.
- README is still a stock Next.js template, so product capabilities are currently clearer in code/spec artifacts than in public docs.

## Stack And Delivery
- Core stack is TypeScript-first with Next.js app architecture and modern React-era frontend patterns.
- Repository setup indicates a full-stack delivery model rather than a static frontend-only project.
- Prior implementation notes point to Drizzle ORM and Cloudflare D1 for data persistence in production-style deployment.
- Deployment/tooling notes indicate Cloudflare worker-oriented delivery with OpenNext and Wrangler-style workflows.
- Default branch is `master`; repo visibility is private, so portfolio curation should include screenshots or writeups for external viewers.

## Portfolio Notes
- Strong candidate for a language-learning product piece: clear domain focus (Cantonese + SRS) and end-to-end application scope.
- Improve showcase value by replacing the default README with product narrative, architecture diagram, and feature walkthrough.
- Add measurable outcomes (retention, review throughput, import volume, or user feedback) to make impact legible to recruiters.
- Consider publishing a sanitized public demo/video plus technical case study if the private repo must remain private.
