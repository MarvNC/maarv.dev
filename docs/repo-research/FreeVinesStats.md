## One-liner
FreeVinesStats is a lightweight React frontend that presents scraped Amazon Vine drop statistics so users can quickly see how drop activity patterns change over time.

## What It Does
- Surfaces Amazon Vine drop statistics in a browser UI instead of raw scraped output.
- Focuses on drop-pattern visibility, helping users spot timing trends and activity shifts.
- Uses data scraped from VineHelper (per README) and turns it into an easier-to-scan dashboard experience.
- Keeps scope intentionally narrow as a focused stats viewer rather than a full Vine automation tool.

## Stack And Delivery
- Frontend app built primarily in TypeScript, with smaller HTML/CSS/JavaScript layers.
- Built as a simple React application (explicitly stated in README).
- Delivered as a live web experience via `https://vine.maarv.dev/`.
- Repository is small and single-purpose, with one default branch (`main`) and no extra topic taxonomy.

## Portfolio Notes
- Good portfolio example of shipping a purpose-built data UI around a niche user workflow.
- Demonstrates product judgment: narrow scope, clear audience, and practical utility over feature sprawl.
- Useful to position as a data-visualization frontend that complements separate scraping/data-pipeline work.
- Current social proof is low (0 stars/forks), so pair with impact metrics (usage, personal workflow wins, iteration speed) when presenting.
