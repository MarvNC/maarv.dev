## One-liner
This repository is a documentation/spec project defining a consistent light novel file and folder naming convention for sorting and machine parsing. It is minimal, maintained, and centered around a single comprehensive README.
## Evidence
- `gh api repos/MarvNC/light-novel-naming-scheme` shows `archived: false`, `pushed_at: 2024-10-16T19:57:46Z`, `updated_at: 2024-10-16T19:57:50Z`, no homepage, and default branch `master`.
- `gh api repos/MarvNC/light-novel-naming-scheme/languages` returned `{}`, so no dominant code language is currently detected by GitHub Linguist.
- `gh api repos/MarvNC/light-novel-naming-scheme/git/trees/master?recursive=1` shows a very small tree with `readme.md`, `package.json`, Prettier config, and a formatting workflow.
- `gh api repos/MarvNC/light-novel-naming-scheme/readme` contains a long specification-style README with goals, filename schema, components, and folder naming rules.
- `gh api repos/MarvNC/light-novel-naming-scheme/contents/package.json` includes only Prettier scripts/devDependency, reinforcing that this is a docs/spec repo rather than an app/library.
