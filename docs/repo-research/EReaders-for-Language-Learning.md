## One-liner
A documentation-first MkDocs site for practical language-learning workflows on Android e-readers, including setup guides, tool integration, and device-focused reference content.

## What It Does
- Publishes structured docs for using e-readers as language-learning tools, centered on real study workflows.
- Covers implementation-oriented topics such as dictionary lookup setup and flashcard mining pipelines.
- Organizes device and usage guidance into browsable Markdown content intended for self-serve learning.
- Serves a live public documentation site at `https://ereaders.maarv.dev/`.
- Prioritizes clarity and maintainability of knowledge over shipping app/backend source code.

## Stack And Delivery
- Built with MkDocs (Python toolchain) and managed through `requirements.txt` for local docs development.
- Uses Bun-managed Node tooling for Prettier formatting across Markdown, YAML, and JSON content.
- Supports local authoring via `mkdocs serve` with live reload for rapid documentation iteration.
- Enforces formatting quality with `bun run format:check` and automated GitHub Actions checks on pushes/PRs.
- Structured as a content repository (`docs/` + `mkdocs.yml`) with static-site delivery to a dedicated homepage.

## Portfolio Notes
- Strong evidence of developer education and documentation craft: clear product scope, operational setup, and maintainable content workflow.
- Best positioned as a documentation/product-enablement project rather than a software application feature build.
- Highlights practical domain depth in language-learning tooling (Android e-readers, lookup flow, and study integration patterns).
- Useful in portfolio curation as a proof of end-to-end knowledge delivery: authoring, formatting standards, CI checks, and public publishing.
