## One-liner
Small AutoHotkey utility that remaps Win and Alt to feel like Command and Option when remoting from Windows into macOS via RustDesk or Parsec.

## What It Does
- Swaps Win/Alt behavior on the local Windows keyboard to match common macOS modifier muscle memory.
- Targets remote desktop workflows where macOS is controlled from a Windows machine.
- Supports RustDesk and Parsec out of the box, based on the README and app-specific positioning.
- Provides a simple end-user flow: download a prebuilt executable from latest releases and run it.

## Stack And Delivery
- Implementation language is AutoHotkey (single-language codebase per GitHub metadata).
- Delivered as lightweight executable binaries rather than requiring users to author scripts manually.
- Release distribution is centered on GitHub Releases with x64/x86 build artifacts referenced in project usage.
- Default development branch is `main`, with an active public repository and issues enabled.

## Portfolio Notes
- Good example of a focused, practical developer tool that solves a real daily-friction UX problem.
- Strong fit for a "workflow polish" or "productivity tooling" portfolio category.
- Repo is early-stage from a social-proof standpoint (0 stars/forks/issues), so portfolio framing should emphasize problem clarity and user utility over traction.
- Clear positioning for remote-desktop-heavy workflows can help differentiate this from generic key-remap scripts.
