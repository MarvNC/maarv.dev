## One-liner
`jpdb-freq-list` is a JavaScript userscript project that exports JPDB deck vocabulary into Yomichan-compatible frequency lists, with downloadable generated lists published in releases. It targets Japanese learners using JPDB/Yomichan tooling.

## Evidence
- GitHub metadata: description is "JPDB Frequency List creation for Yomichan," repo is public, non-archived, owned by `MarvNC`.
- Languages endpoint reports only JavaScript (`10365` bytes), matching the single main script file `jpdb-freq-list.user.js`.
- Repository tree is small and focused: `jpdb-freq-list.user.js`, `readme.md`, and supporting `images/`.
- `readme.md` documents install/use as a userscript (Violentmonkey recommended) and "Export as frequency list" workflow for JPDB decks.
- README also links releases for downloadable frequency lists and notes the list is no longer practically updatable due to JPDB deck-entry limits.
