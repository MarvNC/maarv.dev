## One-liner
Contributor and maintainer work on Yomitan, an actively developed open-source browser extension that helps learners read real-world content with instant dictionary lookup, and that continues the Yomichan project after its sunset.

## What It Does
- Turns web pages into assisted reading workflows with an interactive popup dictionary for in-context lookups.
- Supports language learning across multiple supported languages and dictionary sources, including EPWING import paths via companion tooling.
- Provides built-in pronunciation audio and supports custom audio source configuration.
- Surfaces kanji details such as stroke order diagrams directly from the lookup experience.
- Integrates with Anki via AnkiConnect to automate flashcard creation from looked-up terms.

## Stack And Delivery
- JavaScript-first browser extension codebase delivered for Chrome, Firefox, and Edge, with both stable and testing release channels.
- Node.js and npm based contributor workflow (`npm ci`, build scripts, license report generation) for local development and packaging.
- Project documentation is centralized in the Yomitan Wiki, with repository docs covering setup, language support, templates, and troubleshooting.
- Open-source delivery model with active issue triage, contributor onboarding, and good-first-issue pathways.

## Portfolio Notes
- Strong signal project for OSS maintenance at scale: high community usage, active issue volume, and ongoing browser compatibility work.
- Good fit for demonstrating product-minded platform engineering: language UX, dictionary data pipelines, and cross-browser release constraints.
- Maintainer visibility is high impact here because reliability, contributor throughput, and documentation quality directly affect learner outcomes.
