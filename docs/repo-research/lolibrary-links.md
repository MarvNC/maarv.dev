## One-liner
Tiny browser userscript repo focused on adding direct outbound links from lolibrary.moe pages, with a very low-friction install path from GitHub raw.

## What It Does
- Adds direct link entry points for lolibrary.moe users to external sources, reducing manual searching and copy-paste steps.
- Targets fast click-through behavior for archive/discovery workflows rather than a full standalone app.
- Keeps onboarding simple: the README centers on a single install link to the raw userscript file.
- Operates as a focused utility project with a clear, narrow product surface.

## Stack And Delivery
- JavaScript-based userscript project with a lightweight repository footprint.
- Delivered through GitHub-hosted raw script installation (`lolibrary-links.user.js`) rather than package registries.
- Default branch is `main`, with recent push/update timestamps indicating active maintenance in early 2026.
- Public repository with no homepage and no declared license, which affects external reuse posture.

## Portfolio Notes
- Good example of pragmatic browser augmentation: small scope, direct user value, and minimal operational overhead.
- Demonstrates ability to ship utility tooling where distribution is optimized for immediate end-user adoption.
- README is intentionally minimal; adding short feature bullets and a screenshot could improve evaluator comprehension.
