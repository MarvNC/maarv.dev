## One-liner
ReallySafeSkiing is a live low-poly downhill skiing browser game focused on fast arcade play, physics-based movement, and procedural replayability across desktop and mobile.

## What It Does
- Delivers a playable web game where players ski downhill while avoiding trees, rocks, jumps, cliffs, and high-speed crashes.
- Offers three distinct modes: Sprint (time trial with crash penalties), Arcade (score attack with lives, coins, and airtime multiplier), and Zen (no crash state, no timer, no score pressure).
- Simulates momentum, friction, and air drag with a physics-driven movement model to keep handling skill-based rather than purely scripted.
- Generates infinite terrain chunks with adaptive obstacle placement so runs stay fresh instead of repeating fixed levels.
- Supports both keyboard and touch controls, with dedicated steering and braking interactions for cross-device playability.

## Stack And Delivery
- Frontend app built with React and Vite, with TypeScript as the dominant implementation language.
- Real-time 3D rendering handled by Three.js for the low-poly world and game presentation.
- Core skiing and collision behavior powered by Rapier3D physics.
- Uses Zustand for lightweight game state handling and Tailwind CSS for UI styling.
- Delivered as a publicly accessible browser experience at https://ski.maarv.dev/.

## Portfolio Notes
- Strong hero candidate for game/graphics-oriented portfolios because it is interactive, deployed, and immediately demonstrable.
- Shows end-to-end product execution: gameplay design, simulation tuning, rendering, controls, and production deployment.
- Useful to position under "creative engineering" or "real-time web" work to highlight breadth beyond standard CRUD apps.
- Include short gameplay clips or GIFs in portfolio entries to communicate feel, speed, and mode variety quickly.
